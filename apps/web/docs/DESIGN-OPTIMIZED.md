## üéØ UI Pattern Reference

| Pattern | When to Use | Examples |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Dialog** | Create/edit forms, confirmations, short workflows | Create course, Create cohort, Submit assignment, Grade submission, Quick settings |
| **Slide-over** | View details, related lists, secondary information | User details, Student details, Invoice details |
| **Tabs** | Related content sections, different views of same data | Assignment editor (Settings/Grading/Submissions), Quiz editor, Course settings, Theme editor |
| **Split View** | List + active item, master-detail pattern | Not heavily used in current implementation |
| **Inline Edit** | Quick field updates, simple changes | Cohort details page, Course settings |
| **Full-screen Dialog** | Immersive tasks, focus-required activities | Take quiz, Video player |
| **Data Table** | List views with sorting/filtering | Cohort list, User list, Course list |

- **Reduced bandwidth** - Less data transferred per interaction
- **Improved perceived performance** - Instant visual feedback

### Development
- **Reusable components** - Dialog and form components shared across features
- **Clean routing** - Hierarchical route structure
- **Easier testing** - Test components independently
- **Better maintainability** - Changes localized to components
- **Consistent patterns** - Tab-based editors for complex forms

---

## üöÄ Key Metrics

- **Total Routes:** 54 (well-organized and scalable)
- **Dialogs Used:** Extensively for create/edit operations
- **Tabs Used:** For complex editors (assignments, quizzes, courses, themes)
- **Data Tables:** For all list views with filtering and sorting
- **Mobile Optimized:** 100%
- **Reusable Components:** High reusability across features

---

## üìù Implementation Notes

### Current Architecture
1. **Dialogs for CRUD:** Create and edit operations use `FormDialog` from components library
2. **Tabs for Complex Forms:** Multi-section forms use tab navigation (assignments, quizzes, themes)
3. **Data Tables:** All list pages use `DataTable` component with built-in filtering/sorting
4. **Context Providers:** Complex pages use React Context for state management (cohort-context, assignment-context, etc.)
5. **tRPC for API:** All API calls use tRPC with React Query for caching
6. **Form Validation:** Zod schemas for form validation
7. **Optimistic Updates:** tRPC query invalidation for instant UI updates

### Dialog Usage Pattern
```typescript
// Common pattern across the application
const createDialogControl = useDialogControl();

<CreateDialog 
  control={createDialogControl} 
  onSuccess={() => refetchList()} 
/>
```

### Tab Pattern
```typescript
// Complex editors use tabs
**Tabs:** Settings | Grading | Submissions

**Tab: Settings** - Basic configuration
**Tab: Grading** - Grading-specific settings
**Tab: Submissions** - View and manage submissions
```

### Data Table Pattern
```typescript
// List views with filtering
- Search input
- Status filter dropdown
- DataTable with sorting
- Actions column with dropdown menu
```

---

**Note:** The current implementation emphasizes:
- **Simplicity:** Dialogs for simple operations
- **Organization:** Tabs for complex multi-section forms
- **Consistency:** Reusable patterns across all features
- **Performance:** tRPC + React Query for optimal data fetching
- **User Experience:** Instant feedback and minimal page transitions
